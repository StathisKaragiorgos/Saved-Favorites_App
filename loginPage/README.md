This project is a modern full-stack login and signup application built with React (Vite) on the frontend and FastAPI (Python) on the backend. It features a clean and responsive user interface, secure password handling with bcrypt, and seamless frontend-backend communication using CORS. The project is version-controlled using Git and uploaded to GitHub. Designed as a foundation for more advanced features like database integration and JWT-based authentication, this project demonstrates my ability to build secure, scalable, and user-friendly web applications using Python and JavaScript technologies.
