This project is a React-based multimedia dashboard integrated with a FastAPI backend that allows users to sign up, log in, and navigate through multiple pages using React Router. After authentication, users can explore personalized sections such as videos, photos, and curated music playlists. The app focuses on clean UI, smooth navigation, and a simple user experience, while FastAPI handles secure user management with hashed passwords and structured API endpoints. This project demonstrates full-stack functionality, modern frontend routing, and backend integration—forming a solid foundation for scalable media-based applications.
