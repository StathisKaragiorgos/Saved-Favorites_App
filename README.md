This project is a full-stack multimedia dashboard built with React on the frontend and FastAPI on the backend. Users can sign up, log in, and seamlessly navigate through a modern, clean interface powered by React Router. After successful authentication, users gain access to protected sections, including personalized videos, photos, and curated music playlists.

The frontend now incorporates protected routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access multimedia features. Authentication is managed using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), providing secure and scalable session handling. FastAPI is responsible for user management, password hashing, token generation, and structured API endpoints.
