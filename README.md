This project is a full-stack multimedia dashboard that combines a modern React frontend with a secure and efficient FastAPI backend. Users can create accounts, log in, and navigate through multiple sections of the app using React Router, enjoying a clean UI and smooth, intuitive transitions. With the latest update, the application now features fully protected routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can access personalized multimedia content such as videos, photos, and curated music playlists. Authentication and session management are handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), providing a scalable and secure mechanism for verifying user identity across the application. On the backend, FastAPI manages user registration, password hashing, token issuance, and organized API endpoints, creating a solid foundation for data integrity and system reliability. The integration between the frontend and backend showcases end-to-end functionality, demonstrating how modern tooling can be combined to produce a responsive, secure, and user-friendly experience. This project not only highlights essential full-stack concepts—such as routing, API consumption, and authentication—but also provides a flexible structure that can be expanded into larger media-based or personalized content platforms.
